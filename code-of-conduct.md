## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of UQNeuroTech, we pledge to foster a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We are committed to cultivating an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- **Honesty and Trust**: We value honesty and trust by being open, truthful, sincere, and straightforward in our intentions and actions. We encourage open communication, acknowledge the contributions of others, admit and rectify our mistakes promptly, and uphold the confidentiality and privacy of official UQNeuroTech information.

- **Respect**: We promote a respectful environment that values individuality, diversity, and kindness. We commit to communicate courteously, promote a culture that does not tolerate bullying or harassment, value diversity, and maintain an environment free from all forms of discrimination.

- **Accountability**: We take responsibility for our actions or inactions, comply with relevant requirements, promote good governance principles, and keep up-to-date with advances and changes in neurotechnology.

- **Fairness**: We demonstrate fairness through openness and impartiality in our work and decision-making processes. We are inclusive, impartial, and committed to a workplace free from bullying and harassment.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all UQNeuroTech community spaces and also when an individual is officially representing our community. All members, volunteers, and representatives of UQNeuroTech are expected to act in alignment with this Code while participating in club activities. Violations may result in disciplinary action.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at contact@uqneurotech.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, respecting the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community leads to a private, written warning, providing clarity around the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions results in a warning with consequences for continued behavior. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, results in a temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community.

4. **Permanent Ban**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, results in a permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

This Code of Conduct is a commitment we make as a community to uphold the highest standards of conduct. Together, let's foster a respectful and inclusive environment that encourages learning and growth in the field of neurotechnology.
